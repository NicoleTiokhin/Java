# Garbage Collection 

- automatic memory management process
- Garbage collector identifies and removes unused objects to free up memory
- In other languages like C/C++ you have to manually manage memory , but not in Java

## How does it work ? 

- find objects still referenced somewhere in the program
- objects that are no  longer referenced -> possible for deletion
- garbage collector deletes these unused objects, reclaiming the memory for future use
- garbage collector deletes these objects memory for future use

## Types of Garbage Collection

- Minor or Incremental Garbage Collection :
