# Pokemon game 
Inspired by a simple Pokemon game I wrote when learning Python 
## Pokemon Class 
The Pokemon class represents individual Pokemon 
<ul>
  <li>Attributes : name , health , attackPower </li>
  <li>Methods toaccess and change attributes (Getter&Setter) </li>
  <li>Method for one Pokemon to attack another including a message to player describing the attack and decrease health of traget Pokemon by the attackpower of attacking Pokemon</li>
  <li>Check if PokemonÂ´s health is zero or less -> Pokemon fainted (since they dont die in the game)</li>
</ul>

``` java
    public class Pokemon {
    private String name;
    private int health;
    private int attackPower;

    public Pokemon(String name, int health, int attackPower) {
        this.name = name;
        this.health = health;
        this.attackPower = attackPower;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getHealth() {
        return health;
    }

    public void setHealth(int health) {
        this.health = health;
    }

    public int getAttackPower() {
        return attackPower;
    }

    public void attack(Pokemon target) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " attacks " + target.getName() + " for " + this.attackPower + " damage!");
        target.setHealth(target.getHealth() - this.attackPower);
    }

    public boolean hasFainted() {
        if (this.health <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Your Pokemon has fainted!");
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public String pokedex() {
        return name + " [Health: " + health + ", Attack Power: " + attackPower + "]";
    }
}
```

## Fight Class

 <ul>
  <li>pokemon1 , pokemon2 as instances of Pokemon class </li>
   <li>Scanner object to read user input </li>
   <li>Set first attacker to pokemon1 and first defender to pokemon2 </li>
        <li> Fight Loop : <br> loop goes on until a Pokemon has fainted 
          <br> print out current status of both Pokemon 
          <br> current attacker attacks current defender 
        <br> check if current defender has fainted ; If true then break out of loop and send message
        <br> Temporarily store the current attacker <br>
        current defender becomes the new attacker <br>
        original attacker becomes the new defender <br>
        Prompt user to press Enter to continue <br>
        wait for the user to press Enter <br>
        close Scanner object </li>
 </ul>
